    <h2><i class="fas fa-tasks"></i> The Assessment in 5 Simple Steps</h2>
    <ul class="section-list">
      <li><strong>Clarify Objectives:</strong> Pinpoint what your business needs from the cloud—reduced costs, faster delivery, or robust scalability.</li>
      <li><strong>Assess the Present:</strong> Examine your current cloud setup. Review architecture, workflows, team expertise, spending, and security. Tools like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/">AWS Well-Architected</a> can streamline this.</li>
      <li><strong>Measure Up:</strong> Benchmark your department against industry standards. Are you leading or lagging in automation, resilience, or cost control?</li>
      <li><strong>Identify Weaknesses:</strong> Highlight gaps—perhaps unused cloud features, inefficient processes, or skill shortages holding you back.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Craft a roadmap with short-term fixes (e.g., cost optimisation) and long-term ambitions (e.g., adopting AI or serverless tech).</li>
    </ul>
